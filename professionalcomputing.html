<h2 id="intro"> Introduction </h2>
<p> The word professional has a wide range of meanings. It may be a recognised profession such as medical doctor, lawyer, teacher, dentist, etc. In order to earn that title, one most require substantial education, and the members of the profession decide the nature of the required education or training. The profession has one or more professional bodies and the it lays down standards of conduct which members must comply. </p>

<p> Professional Bodies establish a code of conduct to which members of the profession must abide. They must also establish mechanisms for the dissemination of knowledge and good practice to members. Also, they have to set standards of education and advice government and regulators. </p>

<p> <strong>Reservation of title</strong>: In order to call yourself a member of the profession you must be recognised by the professional body. E.g. To advertise yourself as an architect is illegal without permission of the ARB.  </p>

<p> <strong>Reservation of function</strong>: Also, to carry out the functions associated with the profession, you must be recognised by the body. E.g. to audit the accounts of any public company, you must be recognised by the Assoc of Certified Accountants. </p>

<p> The term "engineer" is unrestricted in the UK. The IT industry is unregulated but we do have a professional body. Our professional body does not have regulatory powers, but it does accredit degree programs, advise the government on IT related issues, disseminate good practice and attempt to define "professional behaviour". </p>

<hr/> <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="legals"> Legal Perspectives </h2>
<h3 id="legals1"> Law </h3>
<p> Law is a complex and difficult thing. Laws have geographical jurisdiction, i.e. those that applies here may not apply in the US. We wil be focusing on English Law. Jurisdiction is not straight forward in terms on computer use. <br/> The law is more than just a set of rules. There are different system of courts, different rules concerning how appeals are made, different rules about how new laws work with old. </p>

<h4> Criminal vs Civil Law </h4>
<p> Most of what this will cover comes under the <strong>Civil law</strong>, which is about negligence, conflicts and disputes between people. But if you are committing an offence against society, then it may be classified under <strong>Criminal law</strong>. <br/> Criminal law is designed to protect society from wrong doers, which may involve police investigation and arrest, then the Crown Prosecution Service may proceed with prosecution. <br> Civil law is mostly settling disputes between people or companies. Litigation must be brought by one of the parties of the dispute (plaintiff) against the another (defendant). Usual objective is to obtain damages, money, or injunction (court order). <br/> The key difference between criminal and civil law is the standards of proof required; in criminal you are "innocent until proven guilty", while in the civil law both parties must present arguments and decision is based on "balance of probabilities". <br/> Hacking is also included in criminal law. </p>

<h4> Tort </h4>
<p> In a common law, a tort is a civil wrong. The action might not necessarily be illegal or criminal, but somehow has caused harm which can be re-addressed through the courts. For example this could be a traffic accident. Torts are usually re-addressed through damages awarded. This is arguable by negligence, but negligence may be enough for someone to bring to court. A nuisance that breaks the peace like playing loud music in the middle of the night may also be a case under tort law. Same goes to defamation (damaging the good reputation of somebody). </p>

<h4> Legislation </h4>
<p> A "Legislative Act of Parliament" (or statute) can create, amend, repeal any new law or existing law. Any statute overrules any previous act or precedent, but not court decisions. The body of law is regularly reviewed by the law commission. This means that you cannot be prosecuted for an offence which the law wasn't created at the time of the offence. </p>

<p> The process of this is usually drafted under supervision of government minister. Then the bill is introduced in the House of Commons or Lords, and after it passes, then it becomes an Act and the law comes to force. </p>

<p> European Union is another layer of complication above this. The council of the European Union and European Parliament have legislative powers. There are laws that are made by the EU and impact directly on English Law, and EU directives can instruct member states to alter their laws. And members of the country are obliged to abide by the law. </p>

<p> What will happen when the UK exits the EU is that the "Great Repeal Act" will happen. Any law that has been forced by the EU will be enacted (practiced) by the British Law, and then those laws will be unwind as per the parliament. In other words, all laws that has been forced by the EU will be converted to the British law, then the law that we don't like can just be unwind. </p>

<h3 id="legals2"> Computer Misuse Act (1990) </h3>
<p> Three offences: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Unauthorised access to a computer </li>
    <li> Unauthorised access to a computer to commit serious crime </li>
    <li> Unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer.</li>
</ul>
<p> A person is guilty of a crime if either they or the computer in question is in the UK at the time of the offence. </p>

<h4> Unauthorised Access Offence </h4>
<p> A person is guilty of an offence if they cause a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access ot any program or data held in any computer, also guilty if the access they intend to secure is unauthorised, and they know at the time they do not have permission. They could be fined or prisoned. </p>

<p> Key points </p>
<ul>
    <li> Knowledge and intent </li>
    <li> Attempt is sufficient, need not be successful </li>
    <li> No requirement of damage done </li>
</ul>

<h4> Serious Crime Intent </h4>
<p> If a person is caught to use the computer for a serious crime like hacking, blackmail, then a more serious punishment will be forced down. Again, need not be successful but if intent can be proven then it is sufficient. </p>

<h4> Unauthorised Modification </h4>
<p> A person is guilty of an offence if they do any act which causes an unauthorised modification of the contents of any computer, and at the time when they do the act they have the requisite intent and the requisite knowledge. </p>
<p> The requisite intent covers: </p>
<ul>
    <li> To impair the operation of any computer </li>
    <li> To prevent or hinder access to any program or data held in any computer </li>
    <li> To impair the operation of such program or the reliability of any such data </li>
</ul>
<p> This may include spreading a virus, encrypting files and demanding a ransom for revealing the key, redirection of browser home pages, etc. </p>

<h4> Issues surrounding CMA </h4>
<p> Common view is that the real issue with computer crime is a lack of resources for investigation and prosecution rather than a lack of laws. Phishing for instance is better dealt as a case of Fraud. </p>

<hr/> <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="data"> Data Protection & Freedom of Information </h2>
<h3 id="data1"> Data Protection Act (1984) </h3>
<p> The law in the UK that governs what you are allowed to do with other people's data is the Data Protection Act. It concerns about large amounts of data being collected about people. Data being used for reasons other than why it was collected. </p>


<p> The European Council then produced a set of principles for what you can or cannot do with other people's data, which is the UK Data Protection Act (1984) designed to protect individuals against: </p>
<ul>
    <li> The use of inaccurate/incomplete personal information </li>
    <li> The use of information by unauthorised persons </li>
    <li> The use of information for reasons other than it was collected for </li>
</ul>
<p> For example, suppose a chain of newsagents collected data on cigarette purchases and sold it to a health insurance company. It is perfectly reasonable for them to collect data through loyalty cards or the like and you are required to sign the terms and conditions, then they are safe by the Data Protection Act because you have consent with it. But if it was not, then they are in breach of the Data Protection Act. </p>

<p> Some definitions: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Data &ndash; Information that is being <em> processed </em> automatically or is collected with the intention or recorded as part of a "relevant filling system". Basically it means that data that is being held in some kind of systematic and searchable way that is relatable back to you as an individual. </li>
    <li> Processing &ndash; Obtaining, recording, or holding data or carrying out any operation on it. Basically anything you can do with data. </li>
    <li> Data Controller &ndash; The person who controls why and how data is processed. </li>
    <li> Data Processors &ndash; The person who processes the data on behalf of the controller. </li>
    <li> Personal Data &ndash; Data which relates to a living person who can be identified using this data. </li>
    <li> Sensitive Data &ndash; Personal data relating to racial, ethnic, religious, political, sexual, etc. aspects of a person. </li>
</ul>
<p> These are pieces of information that people may not want to be publicly available and one should not simply collect data for purposes other than it was collected for. </p>

<h3 id="data2"> DPA Principles </h3>
<h4> First Principle </h4>
<p> Personal Data wil be processed fairly and lawfully unless there are some conditions. These conditions are that one has given consent, or that there is a legal obligation to collect it like tax returns. There is also the possibility of giving <em> Explicit </em> consent. Giving explicit consent requires one to be active like signing a form or some other contracts. The key here is that there must be consent or legal obligation to collect data. </p>

<h4> Second Principle </h4>
<p></p> Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purposes. This should be all written in the terms and conditions. Data can't be collected "just in case it's useful".

<h4> Third Principle </h4>
<p> Data collected should be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which is collected. </p>

<h4> Fourth Principle </h4>
<p> Personal data should be accurate and where necessary kept up to date. </p>

<h4> Fifth Principle </h4>
<p> Personal data processed for any purpose should not be kept longer than it is necessary for that purpose. The length of time the data is kept may vary, but have to be reasonable. Procedures for data deletion must be rigorous and specified (including deletion of backed up data). </p>

<h4> Sixth Principle </h4>
<p> Personal data should be processed in accordance with the rights of the data subjects under this act. Basically means that if you have data you have to obey all these principles. </p>
<ul>
    <li> DPA (1984) <ul>
        <li> Subjects have a right to know whether an organisational data held relating to them, the right to see the data, and the right to have the data corrected or erased if inaccurate. </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li> DPA (1998), you get more things. <ul>
        <li> A description of data being held. </li>
        <li> An explanation of the purpose for this it is being held. </li>
        <li> A description to whom the data can be disclosed. </li>
        <li> An intelligible (readable and understandable) statement of the specific data about them. </li>
        <li> A description of the source of the data. </li>
        <li> If the data is used to automatically make a decision (such as being rejected when asking for a loan), the subject has the right to ask for the decision to be non-automatically and the logic behind the automatic decision. </li>
        <li> Prevent the processing of data likely to cause damage or distress or for direct marketing. </li>
        <li> To be awarded compensation in the case of damage. </li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

<h4> Seventh Principle </h4>
<p> Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction, or damage to personal data. In other words, keeping the data secure is a legal requirement</p>

<h4> Eighth Principle </h4>
<p> Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country ensures an adequate level or protection for he rights and freedoms of data subjects in the relation of processing of data. Specifically allows companies to transfer data over national boundaries. </p>

<p> The DFA is not a key to get any data mentioning you, it is just for you to collect information <strong>about</strong> you. </p>

<h3 id="data3"> Privacy </h3>
<p> There is about one CCTV camera for every 14 people in the UK. Almost everything you do gives away an information about you, especially when connected to the internet. Location services in your mobiles give people information about where you are, bluetooth gives others information about your phone, etc. </p>

<hr/> <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h3 id="data4"> Regulation of Investigatory Powers (2000) </h3>
<p>Framework for lawful interception of computer, telephone and postal messages</p>
<p>ISPs (and most employers) can monitor communications without consent provided it's to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Establish facts</li>
    <li>Ensure company regulations are being complied with</li>
    <li>Ascertain standards which ought to be achieved</li>
    <li>Prevent crime</li>
    <li>Investigate unauthorised use of telecommunications systems</li>
    <li>Ensure effective operation of system (e.g detecting Ddos attacks)</li>
    <li>Find out whether a communication is business or personal</li>
    <li>Monitor but not record calls to confidential counselling helplines run free of charge by the business</li>
</ul>
<p>But such organisations are required to make reasonable efforts to inform users that such interception might take place<br /><br />Interception Warrants</p>
<ul>
    <li>RIPA allows government agencies the right to ask for interception warrants to monitor communications to/from specific persons or organisations</li>
    <li>Police, Inland Revenue etc</li>
</ul>
<h4>Freedom of Information</h4><ul>
    <li>Act to provide clear rights of access of information held by bodies in the public sector - with certain conditions &amp; exemptions</li>
    <li>Where information is exempted from disclosure there is a duty on public body to disclose where, in the public body&rsquo;s view, the public interest in disclosure outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.</li>
    <li>Monitored by the Information Commissioner and &ldquo;Information Tribunal&rdquo; with wide powers to enforce the act</li>
    <li>A&nbsp;duty for all public bodies to adapt a scheme of publication of information which must be approved by the IC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the issues with Freedom of Information are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Potential conflicts between FOI requests and DPA in cases where there is personal data</li>
    <li>Usually FOI requests must be answered within a month of receipt - sometimes impossible or inaccessible (CCTV footage)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Act has been written with good intentions - however we still need to be careful about the actual application of such acts</p>

<hr/> <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<h2 id="contracts"> Contracts and Liabilities </h2>
<h3 id="contracts1"> Contracts </h3>
<p>Contract Law is old English law in England and Wales</p>
<p>All parties intend to make a contract</p>
<p>All parties must be competent to make a contract</p>
<p>There must be a "consideration" - (both parties must receive and provide something)<br /><br /></p>
<p>No requirement of a lawyer, writing or witnesses (though these make it easier to enforce.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minor additions for new technology but fine for most things &hellip; except software<br /><br /></p>
<p>Contracts protect both parties</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed Price Contracts</li>
    <li>Time and Materials</li>
    <li>Consultancy and Contract Hire<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Price Contract</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Typically tailor made, bespoke systems</li>
    <li>A short agreement - (who the parties are &amp; what's been said before is not part of the contract)</li>
    <li>Standard Terms &amp; Conditions - how the supplier normally does business</li>
    <li>A set schedule/Annexes:
        <ul>
            <li>Particular requirements of the contract</li>
            <li>What is supplied</li>
            <li>Deadlines</li>
            <li>What payments are to be made etc<br /><br /></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is to be produced?</strong></p>
<p>Contract must define the "product"</p>
<p>Standard T&amp;Cs refer to an Annex which in turn refers to a Requirements Specification<br /><br /></p>
<p>A good Requirements Specification is difficult to achieve as the client&rsquo;s needs evolve and technologies change.</p>
<p>The contract must address how such changes are accommodated</p>
<p><strong>What is to be delivered?</strong></p>
<p>It is rarely just handing over code<br /><br /></p>
<p>Contract needs to specify exactly what is delivered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Source Code</li>
    <li>Command Files for building executables</li>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Reference/Training/Operation Manuals</li>
    <li>Training</li>
    <li>Test Data &amp; results<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Ownership - who owns the IPR for the software</p>
<p>Confidentiality - should be specified for both parties</p>
<h3 id="contracts2"> Payment </h3>
<p>Payment shall be due within 30 days of&nbsp;the date of&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;an invoice.&nbsp;If&nbsp;payment is delayed by more than&nbsp;30 days, the Company&nbsp;will have&nbsp;the right to terminate the contract or apply a surcharge at&nbsp;an interest rate&nbsp;2%&nbsp;above the bank base lending&nbsp;rate.<br /><br /></p>
<p>It&nbsp;is unlikely&nbsp;such&nbsp;a clause&nbsp;will ever be used.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payment is more likely to be staggered</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial&nbsp;payment&nbsp;of 15% on&nbsp;signing</li>
    <li>Stage payments during&nbsp;project (say at 65% completion)</li>
    <li>25% at acceptance&nbsp;of software</li>
    <li>Final&nbsp;10% at end&nbsp;of contract<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Such&nbsp;staggered payments protect the supplier</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client may go out of&nbsp;business</li>
    <li>Cash&nbsp;flow&nbsp;for supplier<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>How&nbsp;to stagger:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By calendar&nbsp;month&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;the supplier</li>
    <li>By project&nbsp;completion&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;benefits client<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Penalty Clauses</strong></p>
<p>Payment clauses protect the supplier but the client may also add them</p>
<p>Software is often delayed but such penalties are limited</p>
<p>Suppliers are often very reluctant to accept penalty clauses</p>
<p>If the software is really late and penalty is high then the suppliers has no incentive to complete the work</p>
<h3 id="contracts3"> Obligations on client </h3>
<p>Contract needs to specify client obligations; hence it must provide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Documentation</li>
    <li>Access to appropriate staff</li>
    <li>Machine facilities for testing</li>
    <li>Accommodation</li>
</ul>
<p>Most suppliers will have their own standards of testing &amp; quality assurance but large clients will prefer to use their own. All of this needs to be specified in the contract</p>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Client must provide a fixed set of acceptance tests</li>
    <li>Tasks, expected results, accuracy figures etc</li>
    <li>Successful demonstration of system will constitute acceptance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Standard is 90 day warranty</li>
    <li>Any identified errors fixed free of charge</li>
    <li>Beyond this is subject to negotiation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Risk of supplier infringing intellectual property rights of third party</li>
    <li>Usual for contract to indemnify client &amp; supplier so each other is not liable for any infringement by the other due to own fault</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>It's not uncommon for projects to be cancelled as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client may go bust</li>
    <li>Or may merge with a larger company</li>
    <li>Technology becomes obsolete</li>
</ul>
<p>Contract needs to detail what payments to supplier for unfinished project &amp; what intellectual property rights exist</p>
<p><strong>Arbitration</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>So far contracts are complex</li>
    <li>Litigation is very expensive (and often not worth it)</li>
    <li>Contract may specify that in the case of a dispute the opinion of an independent arbitrator will decide</li>
    <li>Avoids legal costs</li>
    <li>BCS maintains a list of qualified IT arbitrators</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time &amp; Materials (also called "Cost plus" Contracts)</strong></p>
<p>Supplier agrees to develop software</p>
<ul>
    <li>Payment based on costs incurred plus daily rate</li>
    <li>Acceptance tests, payments etc - are far less complex</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually cheaper than fixed price contracts</p>
<p>Sometimes project is unclear - a fixed price is impossible</p>
<p>Currently there's a shift from T&amp;M to Fixed Price contracts in IT (especially in public spending)</p>
<p><strong>Contract Hire</strong></p>
<p>Fixed Price contracts are complex</p>
<p>Contract Hire offers a far simpler alternative</p>
<ul>
    <li>Supplier provides services of staff for a fixed period with agreed hourly/daily rates</li>
    <li>Client takes responsibility for managing staff</li>
    <li>Termination by either side can be done at a short notice</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contracts4"> Consultancy </h3>
<p><strong>Consultancy</strong> - expert analysis of a key part of business</p>
<ul>
    <li>Usually produces a report rather than a product</li>
    <li>Consultancy is usually done at a fixed price</li>
    <li>Small amounts of cash involved</li>
    <li>Harder for a report to fail an acceptance test</li>
    <li>Reputation of consultant usually is enough</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Issues with Consultancy:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>There need to be safe guards to ensure consultant doesn't profit against the client following project</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Terms of reference</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>What is the consultancy meant to be looking at?</li>
        <li>Often the issue isn't what was originally agreed</li>
        <li>This is a major source of disagreements</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Who controls the final version?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Usually client approves a draft version of the document</li>
        <li>Client may require amendments</li>
        <li>This might damage the consultant&rsquo;s reputation</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Liability</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Few consultants wish to be liable for their expert advice</li>
        <li>Most clients disagree - and need to verify the consultant really is an expert</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="contracts5"> Liability </h3>
<p>Most suppliers&nbsp;are very&nbsp;reluctant to agree&nbsp;to any&nbsp;liability for defective&nbsp;software&nbsp;or hardware</p>
<p>Standard&nbsp;Terms &amp; Conditions&nbsp;will usually&nbsp;limit liability&nbsp;to project&nbsp;cost or even&nbsp;a&nbsp;fraction of&nbsp;this</p>
<p>The Law disagrees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unfair Contract Act (1977)</li>
    <li>Impossible&nbsp;to limit liability&nbsp;in the result of a death&nbsp;or personal injury</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumer Protection</strong></p>
<p>If the client is a "consumer" then:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client is a private person</li>
    <li>Supplier is acting as a business</li>
    <li>Goods are of a type usual for private use</li>
</ul>
<p>Sale of Goods Act (1979) - Goods must be fit for purpose</p>
<p>Otherwise, Supply of Goods and Services (1982) - Goods are produced with "reasonable" care</p>
<p>It's unclear whether software counts as "goods"</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shrink wrapped, licenced software probably is</li>
    <li>Bespoke systems are probably not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="property"> Intellectual Property </h2>
<p><strong>Theft</strong>: the "intentional taking of somebody else's property with the intention of permanently depriving them of it"</p>
<p>Different types of Intellectual Property rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copyright</li>
<li>Patents</li>
<li>Confidential Information</li>
<li>Trademarks<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property1"> Copyright </h3>
<p>Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988</p>
<p>Copyright (computer programs) Regulations 1992<br /><br /></p>
<p>The owner of any intellectual property work has certain exclusive rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to make copies of the work</li>
<li>The right to issue copies of the work to the public (either paid or for free)</li>
<li>The right to adapt the work e.g translating form English to Japanese (or Java to C)</li>
<li>These rights are automatic</li>
</ul>
<p>Anybody must request permission (but often permission is implicit e.g webpages)</p>
<p>Copyright does not stop anybody publishing identical work (so long as they came up with the idea independently) &ndash; only copied work</p>
<p>Copyright lasts 70 years after the death of the author.<br /><br /></p>
<p>What can you do without permission?</p>
<p>It's not an infringement to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a backup of a program you are authorized to use (only 1 copy)</li>
<li>You can decompile code to correct any errors (also if you need to write new code to interoperate with it)</li>
<li>You can sell your right to use a program (but you can't keep a copy)<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Databases</strong></p>
<p>Copyright obviously applies to databases where "content is of the authors own creation"</p>
<p>Database Copyright:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is "substantial investment in obtaining, verifying or presenting the contents of the database"</li>
<li>Lasts for 15 years from creation (but renews if database is modified)<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property2"> Infringement </h3>
<ul>
<li>Primary Infringement
<ul>
<li>Exclusive rights of copyright holder are infringed</li>
<li>Civil issue - damages, injunctions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Secondary Infringement
<ul>
<li>Primary infringement in a business context
<ul>
<li>Selling copies</li>
<li>Using pirated software in a business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Criminal Issue - substantial fines, imprisonment etc<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of software uses DRM</p>
<p>Providing information about how to avoid DRM is the same as actual copyright infringement<br /><br /></p>
<h3 id="property3"> Patents </h3>
<p>Patents Act 1977</p>
<p>A patent is a temporary right granted by the state enabling the inventor to prevent other people from copying his work without permission<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patents must be applied for but are far stronger than copyright - prevents other from coming up with the same solution</p>
<p>Patents were meant to encourage innovation - they reword the inventor a grace period to recoup development costs (or more realistically licence the patent to entrepreneurs)<br /><br /></p>
<p>For a product to be patents it must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>New - applies to the inventor as much as anybody</li>
<li>Involves an inventive step - Isn't an obvious solution anybody well qualified might do</li>
<li>Is capable of industrial application - is practical</li>
<li>Is not in an area specifically excluded &ndash; no scientific theories, mathematical methods etc<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Obtaining &amp; Enforcing</p>
<p>Patents are granted nationally. Technically you need to apply in each country but there are trade schemes such as WIPO, European PO etc.</p>
<p>Timing is crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of initial application determines what is &ldquo;new&rdquo;</li>
<li>Full patent specification requires specialist work</li>
<li>Often takes four years to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computing being a global business requires the patent to be taken out in enough countries to ensure it is challengeable.</p>
<p>Enforcing a patent is difficult, many patents are contested.</p>
<p>Patent enforcement costs time and money so many small companies often cannot contest patents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="property4"> Software Patents </h3>
<p>USA</p>
<ul>
<li>US Patent and Trademark Office has always refused to patent software</li>
<li>Changed in 1981 &ndash; patent for curing rubber (using software to determine required heat)</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently &ndash; software can be patented if:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is part of a product that can be patented</li>
<li>controls some process with a physical effect (or)</li>
<li>Processes data that arises from the natural world</li>
</ol>
<p>UK &amp; Europe</p>
<p>European Patent Convention &amp; Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988</p>
<ul>
<li>Technically software cannot be patented</li>
<li>But several countries do in fact patent software<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Eu Commission produced a draft directive (2002)</p>
<ul>
<li>Since then heavily modified</li>
<li>Unlikely to be accepted by anybody</li>
</ul>
<p>Software Patents are a&nbsp;mess.</p>
<p>Patents are designed to reward innovation</p>

<p><strong><br />Copyleft</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Political/Software Philosophy</li>
<li>Software is released as "free"</li>
<li>No restrictions on re-use/modification/copying</li>
<li>EXCEPT any resulting code must also be free</li>
<li>ie You can do anything with this code except change the licence to "not free"</li>
<li>Example: GNU General Public Licence for Software v3.0<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="property5"> Confidential Information </h3>
<p>Often work involves an obligation of confidence</p>
<ul>
<li>g. software development for a company might reveal commercially sensitive information</li>
<li>Conditions of employment for employees</li>
<li>Long periods of notice for employees with sensitive knowledge</li>
<li>Clauses in consultancy agreements for consultants<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Even without such conditions, obligations might occur under Equity. <br /> Obligation occurs if a reasonable person in such a position would reasonably understand that information was given in confidence.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Public Interest Disclosure Act (1998)</p>
<p>Information can be disclosed if the employee believes any of the following might occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>A criminal offence</li>
<li>Failure to comply with a legal obligation</li>
<li>A miscarriage of justice</li>
<li>Danger to health and safety</li>
<li>Environmental damage</li>
<li>Information that of these have been concealed</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="property6"> Trademarks &amp; Passing Off </h3>
<p>Any sign capable of being represented graphically which is capable of distinguishing goods and services &hellip;</p>
<p>Extremely useful to protect some kinds of retail software &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>the software maybe difficult to protect</li>
<li>Logos are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trademarks can be either registered or not</p>
<ul>
<li>UK via the Patent Office</li>
<li>Many countries require registration before legal protection</li>
<li>The US and Canada do not &hellip;</li>
<li>Rules for what can be a trademark (i.e. not people&rsquo;s names or places)</li>
</ul>
<p>UK 1994 Act makes it illegal to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply unauthorised trademark to goods</li>
<li>Sell or hire goods with such a trademark</li>
<li>Have in the course of business such goods</li>
<li>This is usually a criminal office but civil actions can also be brought</li>
</ul>
<p>UK law also protects unregistered trademarks</p>
<ul>
<li>Tort of Passing off</li>
<li>Civil action (but far less strong than registered trademarks)</li>
</ul>
