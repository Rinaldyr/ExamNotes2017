# ExamNotes2017
Notes for UoB CS exam 2017 made purely with HTML/Javascript/CSS.
Notes can be found [here](https://rinaldyr.github.io/ExamNotes2017 "https://rinaldyr.github.io/ExamNotes2017").

Making notes while learning these languages feels like "killing two birds with one stone".

Anyone who finds this is welcome to use it or help build it up before exam starts.
Hopefully these notes will remain useful for the future generations too! 

### Notes Templates Guide
No need to follow, but it might be useful if you wanna do some notes making in html (for this project). Most of these already have CSS bound to them. 

`<h1> Module Title </h1>` &ndash; For module title

`<h2> 1 &ndash; Section </h2>` &ndash; For section 1 title

`<h3> 1.1 &ndash; Subsection </h3>` &ndash; For subsection 1.1 title 

`<h4> Subsubsection </h4>` &ndash; For subsubsection title

`<hr/> <!--------------------->` &ndash; A horizontal line to indicate section finished. 
 <hr/> <!--------------------->
 
`<keyword> keyword </keyword>` &ndash; To emphasise a <keyword style="color: #c976c6; font-weight: bold;">keyword</keyword>. This is a custom tag so it will only work for this project. 

`<strong> another keyword </strong>` &ndash; For <strong> another keyword </strong>

`<code> Line of code </code>` &ndash; For any line of code. Makes the font <code>monospaced</code>. 
```html
<pre>
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello world");
        }
    }
</pre>
```
For any block of code. This also recognises tabs and white spaces. So just type code inside this tag as usual. Output of above: 
<pre>
    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello world");
        }
    }
</pre>
