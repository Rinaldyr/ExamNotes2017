# ExamNotes2017
Notes for UoB CS exam 2017 made purely with HTML/Javascript/CSS.

Making notes while learning these languages feels like "killing two birds with one stone".

Anyone who finds this is welcome to use it or help build it up before exam starts.
Hopefully these notes will remain useful for the future generations too!
